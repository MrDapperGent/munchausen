00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,943
Umhhh, damn my car got broken...

3
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,909
Hi there!

4
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:52,958
Hi!

5
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:58,550
What an amazing car you have. It seeems 
like you can travel at any terrain on it!

6
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:06,091
Yes, it's really so. I have constructed that car
by myself and it is fastest one in the world.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,791
Look, I just need a good driver with 
a car. Do you want to work on me?

8
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,375
OK. People call me Streetracer,
by the way.

9
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,350
Nice to meet you. I'm the famous traveler -
Boris Munchausen.

10
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,583
By accident, are you..

11
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,250
Yes, I'm his relative.

12
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:31,000
The Adventures of Boris Munchausen 1.01

13
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:39,375
I'm getting hungry, my stomach aches...

14
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:44,916
Look, there's someone sitting on the roadside. 
Lets ask him is there any fast-food around.

15
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:50,000
Young man, can you tell us, is there 
any place to eat nearby?

16
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:54,541
Of course there is! Go ride ahead, after 300
meters turn right...

17
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:59,628
Then turn right again. After 140 meters 
turn left and park your car. 

18
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,525
Then walk 8 meters along the parapet and you 
will see "Scholar" eating-house.

19
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,491
But don't even think of ordering
mushroom soup there!

20
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,953
Because chef just drop sulfur-tuft 
into this dish by accident.

21
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,208
How did you know that?

22
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:23,250
Oh, I do know a lot. I'm connecting to the military
satellite unit and watching the whole world.

23
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:26,816
Very cool! I might need a help of such talent.
Do you want to travel with us?

24
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,125
I'll stand the damages.

25
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,166
Of course. I've just got hungry right now.

26
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,500
Here he is!

27
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,493
He's got a gun, must be a hitman!

28
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:20,150
Get him! Grab him!

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,050
Gun, take the gun first!

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,900
Let's show him what is what!

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,433
Who do you think you are?
Why did you tried to kill us?

32
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:27,625
Oh, but...

33
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,580
Then why did you shoot?

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,541
Wait! Now I see, he did't tried to kill us!

35
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,333
He have made ricochet shot through 
the stone on the roadside...

36
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:40,000
...and hit the fly, which was sitting on our
car near the right rear wheel...

37
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,916
...while we were riding
at the speed of 140 km/h.

38
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:52,041
You really surprising me!
Yes, that was a genuine perfect shot.

39
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:53,208
Thanks.

40
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:57,107
Without any doubt, he is a
greatest sniper in the world.

41
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:58,982
Well, I guess now there's no need
to introduce myself.

42
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,875
Look, I'm gathering a crew for one campaign.
And I need someone like you.

43
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,407
Do you want to join us? I pay well.

44
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,045
I love money!

45
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:26,071
Hurry, drive to this crowd! 
Looks like there is a fight there...

46
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,510
Hey, what's happening here?

47
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,392
We were going to pull down this old building...

48
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:43,414
And this man just intentionally attacked us 
and broke our machine with his fists.

49
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,934
What an amazing power! We need
this man. Sniper!

50
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,560
Yes?

51
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:50,937
Get this crowd away.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,562
Roger that.

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,685
I need a person with such abilities like yours.
Do you want to travel with us?

54
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:06,453
With much pleasure. No one is happy
to see me here anyway.

55
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:38,165
This castle belongs to Salladin Hottab 4th, 
from the family of Red.

56
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,063
Red?

57
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,456
Look at the flags.

58
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,327
I see.

59
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,860
I've heard of him. He is very greedy and evil person...

60
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,237
Yes, here's a file on him.

61
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,425
I know, but I think that we should 
to have a go at visiting his castle.

62
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,373
I don't like this idea.

63
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,102
Yes, as I've heard, 
it's easy to enter his castle...

64
00:05:55,307 --> 00:06:01,308
...but if something will go wrong -
there's no chance to escape.

65
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,786
Man, I don't like this Saladin Hottab...

66
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,985
Still, I think we should go there. I'm sure we will
be able to fool this Salladin Hottab.

67
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:09,431
I will generously reward you all,
when we will return.

68
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:14,561
OK, we will go with you.
But we don't like it.

69
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,634
To be continued...
